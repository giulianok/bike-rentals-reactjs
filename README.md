# Bike Rentals

I used ReactJS for this project and I built the styling for scratch, I could've used a library like Bootstrap, but felt that that would introduce a giant library that isn't 100% needed for the size of this app, and it would've added some limitations in terms of design.

## Run

Requires `nodejs`. Used `node v13.1.0` and `npm v6.12.1`.

### Instructions

- Install nodejs locally.
- In the project folder, run `npm i && npm start`.
- Once the build finished, a new browser window should pop-up.
